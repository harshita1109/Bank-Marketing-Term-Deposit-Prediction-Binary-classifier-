# Logistic Regression Model for Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction

## 📘 Project Overview
This project builds a **Logistic Regression Model** using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. 
The dataset contains information about customers and marketing campaign interactions conducted by a Portuguese banking institution.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a predictive model that helps identify potential customers likely to subscribe to a term deposit, enabling data-driven marketing strategies.

## 🧠 Model Details
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- Target Variable: Term Deposit Subscription (Yes/No)
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, AUC Score

## ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing (handling categorical and numerical data)
2. Feature Selection and Splitting Dataset
3. Model Training using Logistic Regression
4. Model Evaluation and Visualization (ROC, confusion matrix)
5. Prediction on new unseen data

## 📊 Results
The model successfully classifies customers likely to subscribe to term deposits, offering insights to optimize marketing efforts.

## 🧩 Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook file `Logistic Regression Model for Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction.ipynb`.
3. Run all cells to train and test the model.
4. To predict new data, modify the `new_data` DataFrame and run the prediction cell.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This model provides valuable predictive insights for targeted marketing, helping banks improve customer engagement and conversion rates.
